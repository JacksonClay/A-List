          There are sub-companies of the A-List such as Monti Motors, Monti Munitions, and Monti Marksmen. Monti Motors offers their Rapid Roadside Repairs service as well as vehicle production to order. Chee Masters has every land vehicle blueprint available. Monti Munitions is focused on providing citizens with large quantities of magazines, they have most mags available on the market.

          The Monti Marksmen are the newly added sub-group of A-List. We offer a wide range of weapons from pistols to fully automatic rifles. while most weapons will be immediately available through the auction, we will accept custom orders for weaponry. Higher order numbers are able to receive a discount for their order.

      You can usually find us all hanging around Monti Motorz located in Montignac, right next to the event shop.  When the crew isn't at the shop or pumping out product for our growing list of sub-companies, you can usually find us up on Pennant's Pass helping out the new people on the island.
