Monti Munitions is focused on providing citizens with large quantities of magazines, they have most mags available on the market.

          The Monti Marksmen are the newly added sub-group of A-List. We offer a wide range of weapons from pistols to fully automatic rifles. while most weapons will be immediately available through the auction, we will accept custom orders for weaponry. Higher order numbers are able to receive a discount for their order.

      You can usually find us all hanging around Monti Motorz located in Montignac, right next to the event shop.  When the crew isn't at the shop or pumping out product for our growing list of sub-companies, you can usually find us up on Pennant's Pass helping out the new people on the island.

        There's something truly special about The Stoner's Cafe. They've cultivated a welcoming atmosphere that fosters creativity and good vibes. The DJ of Light always seem to know exactly what to spin to get the mood just right. We both prioritize creating a space where people can relax, unwind, and connect with each other, and they do it in such a unique and inviting way. It's inspiring to see their continued success.
